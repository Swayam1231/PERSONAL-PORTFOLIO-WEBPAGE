I designed and developed this personal portfolio website using basic front-end technologies — just HTML and CSS — to showcase my web development work. I built it entirely in VS Code, focusing on clean structure, responsive design, and smooth navigation.
This is a single-page responsive portfolio, and it acts as my online resume where visitors can learn about me, view my featured projects, and find my contact details
